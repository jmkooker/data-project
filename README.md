# data-project

## the data file
Located here is a data file called *data-project.txt* 

There is a smaller test-data.txt file for testing.

## the goals

--Your task is to read the file and organize the records **by color**.

--Use a git to track changes the project. Make lots of small commits.
 
--Use maven

--Make a GUI.

--Make a Person object that is immutable. Color and Date should not be stored as strings.

--Use comparable to sort by name, color, company.

 --Unit Test the sort
 
 --Write out XML format.

## Bonuses
  
  --Functional style
  
  --showing off any skill by implementing a feature.
  
   Note: this feature should be demonstratable in the running/results of the project however it can be completely unrelated to the task.

Here is my project:
