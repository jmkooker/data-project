# data-project

## the data file
Located here is a data file called *data-project.txt* 

There is a smaller test-data.txt file for testing.

## the goal

--Your task is to read the file and organize the records **by color**.

--Make a GUI.

## Bonuses

  --for creatively sorting/organizing the records.
  
  --Using a git to submit the project.
  
  --Using a build system like maven
  
  --Unit Test
  
  --Functional style
  
  --showing off any skill by implementing a feature.
  
   Note: this feature should be demonstratable in the running/results of the projet however it can be completely unrelated to the task.

Here is my project:
